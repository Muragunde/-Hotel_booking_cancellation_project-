###  Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing a hotel booking dataset to uncover key business insights that can help optimize occupancy rates, revenue, and customer satisfaction. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn, I performed data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to answer several data-driven business questions.

### Objective
To explore booking patterns, cancellations, customer behavior, and seasonal trends for two hotel types — City Hotel and Resort Hotel — and help stakeholders make data-informed decisions.

### Tools & Techniques
-- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
-- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
-- Data Aggregation: groupby() functions
-- Charts: Bar charts, Pie charts, Count plot


### Data Analysis Project Steps:
1. Create a Problem Statement.
2. Identify the data you want to analyze.
3. Explore and Clean the data.
4. Analyze the data to get useful insights.
5. Present the data in terms of reports or dashboards using visualization.


### Questions and respective solution(it maybe visual screenshot or report screenshot)
1). Analyze the reservation cancellation status in the hotel bookings dataset. Calculate the percentage distribution of canceled vs. non-canceled reservations and visualize this using a bar chart.

2). Compare the reservation cancellation status across different types of hotels. Use a count plot to visualize how many bookings were canceled and not canceled for each hotel category.

3). What is the cancellation rate (in percentage) for Resort Hotel and City Hotel individually?
summary :

** Resort Hotel
is_canceled
0    0.72025
1    0.27975
Name: proportion, dtype: float64


** City Hotel
is_canceled
0    0.582918
1    0.417082
Name: proportion, dtype: float64

4). Perform a time-based analysis of reservation cancellations and pricing trends in Resort and City hotels.
